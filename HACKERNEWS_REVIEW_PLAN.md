### 🎯 Priority 10: Launch Preparation

#### HN Post Draft
```
Title: Constitutional.seq – Principled CDS retrieval for mRNA therapeutics

Text: I built a tool to solve a specific problem in mRNA therapeutic development: 
getting the "right" coding sequence for any human gene. The challenge isn't 
just downloading sequences (Entrez does that), but selecting the canonical 
transcript from dozens of variants using a scientific hierarchy (MANE Select > 
RefSeq > UniProt > longest).

Why this matters: Wrong transcript = wrong protein = failed therapeutic.

Features:
- Hierarchical selection (MANE Select, RefSeq, UniProt canonical)
- GUI and CLI interfaces
- Batch processing with checkpoint/resume
- Handles gene aliases automatically
- Exports to TSV/Excel for wet lab use

MIT licensed, seeking feedback from bioinformaticians and mRNA researchers.

```

### Expected Questions/Criticisms

1. **"Why not use existing tools?"**
   - Response ready: Existing tools don't implement principled selection hierarchy

2. **"Only for human genes?"**
   - Response ready: Yes, focused on human therapeutics initially

3. **"Why the name Constitutional.seq?"**
   - Response ready: Inspired by Constitutional AI - principled, rule-based selection

4. **"Performance?"**
   - Response ready: Processes 100 genes in ~30 seconds with caching

5. **"Real-world usage?"**
   - Response ready: Used for [specific use case if available]

## Review Execution Order

1. **Security sweep** (Priority 2) - Do this first!
2. **README polish** (Priority 1) - Most important for HN
3. **Test basic workflows** (Priority 4) - Ensure it actually works
4. **Scientific accuracy** (Priority 3) - Credibility crucial
5. **Documentation review** (Priority 5) - Completeness check
6. **Performance verification** (Priority 7) - Back up any claims
7. **Final polish** (Priority 9) - Typos and formatting
8. **Prepare HN post** (Priority 10) - Draft and responses
